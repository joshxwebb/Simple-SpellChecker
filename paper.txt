Four scor and seven years ago our fathrs brought forth on this contiinent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, 
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated,
 can long endure. We aremet on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that 
field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is 
alltogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecratey -- we can not hallow -- this ground. 
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poir power to add or 
detract. The world will litle note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forgit what they did 
here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here 
have thus fqar so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before 
us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devtion to that cause for which they gave the last full 
measure of devotion -- that we here higfly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this 
nation, underr God, shall have a newbirth of fredeom -- and that governmxent of the people, by the people, 
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
